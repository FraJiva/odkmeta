ODK notes
---------

From SurveyCTO: "[Field] names must begin with a letter, colon, or underscore.
Subsequent characters can include numbers, dashes, and periods."

List names are much less restrictive: they may include even spaces or single or
double quotes. List names are case-sensitive. -odkmeta- requires that list names
be Stata names.
